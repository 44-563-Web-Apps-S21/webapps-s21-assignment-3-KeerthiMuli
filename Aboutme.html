    <h1>Enhanced Senses</h1>
<p>
    Daredevil is perhaps the exemplar of super-enhanced senses, even though he is missing one -- sight. 
    However, his other hyper-powered senses more than make up for it, and are invaluable when it comes 
    to fighting and winning battles. Of course, as is a running theme on this list, it is dependent on 
    the hero being skilled at hand-to-hand combat. For Daredevil, it also includes hearing a person's 
    heartbeat and using his heightened senses to help spot imposters in battle.

    Another great example is Taskmaster, who has such heightened senses that he can watch a hero fight and 
    immediately have the skills to replicate everything he witnessed, or Spider-Man, who has his very own 
    "spider-sense" which warns him of danger. These powers aid a superhero or villain in a fight immensely, 
    but like other lower ranked powers, the superhero or villain also has to have other powers or enhanced 
    fighting skills in order to supplement this superpower.
