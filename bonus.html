    <h1>The Yellow-gold Lion</h1>
<p>
    
The endless plains of East Africa is a paradise for lions. The most social of all cats, lions form prides that are unlike any other animals. 
Together, theyâ€™ll hunt, raise their young and defend their territory. The pride welcomes new babies every year, but new children bring new dangers.

<ol>
    <li>The Trailhead for the Lion's Lair Trail is located along Sunshine Canyon Drive a little over a mile from the Centennial Trailhead.</oli>
    <li>In Boulder, take Mapleton Ave west until it becomes Sunshine Canyon Drive. </li>
    <li>Continue west for about 1 mile and the trailhead will be on the right.</li>
    <li>The trailhead may be hard to spot.  Look for the large wood steps rising from a wide private road.</li>
    <li>There is not parking along the private road but there is parking just around the corner on Sunshine Canyon Drive, enough space for about 6 cars.</li>
    <li>If this parking is full, continue west on Sunshine Canyon Drive for 1/2 mile to the access point for the Lion's Lair Spur Trail.  Parking at the spur trailhead cuts about 1 mile (RT) from the hike.</li>
